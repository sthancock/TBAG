# TBAG

This will eventually contain the code to run an Arduino based procedures trainer for a buccaneer cockpit.


## bucc\_procedures

This is the primary flight simulator. It contains the code and circuit diagram to build a procedures trainer for a buccaneer, using the original cockpit instruments.


## Instrument test

This contains code and circuit diagrams to directly drive each instrument for testing.


## learners

A folder containing some small tests done along the way to understand the cockpit instruments and Arduino.
