# TBAG

This will eventually contain the code to run an Arduino based procedures trainer for a buccaneer cockpit.


## bucc\_procedures

This is the primary flight simulator. All other folders have been moved to ``learners''.


## learners

A folder containing some small tests done along the way to understand the cockpit instruments and Arduino.


## Instrument test

This contains a piece of code to directly drive each instrument, without the full startup simulator.
