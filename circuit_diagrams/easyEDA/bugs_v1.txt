Some connections were not made in the version 1 PCB.

The connection from the LP spin driver pin and the ribbon connector was missed. This needs soldering from Arduino pin D45 to U10 pin 4

Two of the ground pins on the RPM H-bridges need soldering to an adjacent ground pin.


Eng 2 oil press 3 needs soldering to ground.

Air start arduino pibk up is the wrong side of resistor. No fix so lock on for now.
