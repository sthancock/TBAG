Check the resistance values for the TGT resitors and capacitors.


The connection from the LP spin driver pin and the ribbon connector was missed. This needs soldering from Arduino pin D45 to U10 pin 4. Fixed in rev2.

Two of the ground pins on the RPM H-bridges need soldering to an adjacent ground pin. Fixed in rev2.


Eng 2 oil press 3 needs soldering to ground. Fixed in rev2.

Air start arduino pin is on the wrong side of resistor. No fix so lock on for now. Fixed in rev2.
